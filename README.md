# MLSA-Backend-Recruitments

# Recruitment Task - 1 (Backend): 

## The Idea
You will be building an exclusive marketplace app for BITSians. Students can use the app to sell products like books, cycles, kettles etc to other students on campus. The seller can list an item up for sale with a minimum bidding price and other students can place bids on listed items. The seller can then select a bid and finalize a deal (once the deal is finalized, communication can happen outside the app).

## Implementing the Idea
You must implement the project using the Django framework.
### Resources:
* https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCCezIgC97PvUuR4_gbFUs5g
* https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/4.0/intro/
* https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/

As for the client, you are free to either:
* Implement the backend+frontend using templates
* Implement an API that can be used by a frontend developer. Note: No need to develop the frontend in this case.

## Mandatory Features
* User authentication. Users must be able to register/login to your app. Do this using username/password or OAuth.
* Each user must have a profile in which they can add/update data. This data can be: Name, Bio, Profile Pic, etc.
* Users should be able to add items for sale. Items must have a photo, a description, and a base price.
* Users should be able to place bids on items. Bids must have a price which is greater than the base price.
* Let the user see a feed on the homepage. This feed should include items that are up for sale. Note that this should exclude items that have already been sold.
* Implement a logic for items to be marked as sold once the seller selects a bid.

## Bonus Features
Once you are done with the mandatory features, here are a few ideas for you to extend the app. Note that you are not expected to implement any of these. Theyâ€™re just here to give you ideas to stand out.

* Let admins shadow ban a user for posting spam.
* Categorize items into lists.
Feel free to add features not mentioned above :)

## Evaluation
While evaluating your code, we will look at the following:

* Your database structure and its implementation in models
* Readability of your code
* Your ability to explain and describe your design choices (in the code)
* Your creativity as a developer

You are expected to complete the task within a week.
